This project uses a tool called "Create React App" to help create a web application using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The following are the available commands you can use:

1. `npm start`: This command starts the application in development mode. It will open the app in your web browser at http://localhost:3000, and any changes you make to the code will automatically reload the page.

2. `npm test`: This command launches a test runner that checks your code for any errors or issues. It works in an interactive watch mode, meaning it will re-run the tests whenever you make changes to the code.

3. `npm run build`: This command builds the application for production. It optimizes the code for better performance and creates a folder called "build" containing the production-ready files. These files are ready to be deployed to a web server.

4. `npm run eject`: This command is a one-way operation. It allows you to customize the build tool and configurations fully. However, once you eject, you can't go back to the default settings.

The project also provides documentation and resources to help you learn more about React and its features. You can find the documentation links for Code Splitting, Analyzing the Bundle Size, Making a Progressive Web App, Advanced Configuration, and Deployment. These resources will guide you on how to use React effectively and deploy your application.

If you encounter any issues with the "npm run build" command, there are troubleshooting resources available to help you resolve the problem.

Overall, this project simplifies the process of creating a React web application and provides various scripts to aid in development, testing, and deployment.
